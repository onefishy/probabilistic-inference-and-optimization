"""Which cells of the author's solution notebooks answer which book question.

Used by `add_solutions.py`. Only the author's own answers are used: a question with no
matching answer in the sources gets no solution and is listed in GAPS instead.

Source keys name the folder a notebook sits in (HW3 is HW_3/, which holds the Fall 2019
"Homework #2" solutions; the questions match the book's wording).

A solution is `S(page, after, title, *segments)`:
  page      book notebook stem (chapters/ or labs/)
  after     text that occurs in exactly one cell of the page: the solution goes after it
            (solutions sharing an anchor keep their order here)
  title     dropdown title, numbered as the reader sees the question
  segments  md(src, cell, start, end, fixes)  prose from a markdown cell, between the
                                              start and end markers (both excluded)
            code(src, cell, out, fixes)       a code cell and (out=True) its saved outputs
            ran(step)                         code and outputs of a re-run step (RERUN)
            text(markdown)                    connecting text written for the book
            note(markdown)                    "*Not covered here: ...*" for partial answers
`fixes` are exact (old, new[, count]) edits; a fix that no longer matches stops the run.
`[[ps:KEY]]`, `[[ch:LECTURE]]` and `[[lab:N]]` placeholders become cross-references.
